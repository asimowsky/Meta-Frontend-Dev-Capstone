# Features
Image Animation
The web app incorporates image animation to enhance the user experience and make the interface more engaging.

Responsive Design
The application is built with a responsive design, ensuring that it adapts and looks great on different devices and screen sizes.

Multilingual Support
Little Lemon Restaurant supports three languages: English, French, and German. The i18next library is used for translation purposes, allowing users to switch between languages seamlessly.

Page Routing
React Router is utilized for page routing, enabling users to navigate through different sections of the web app easily.

Toast Notifications
Toast notifications are implemented using the react-hot-toast library. Users receive notifications when performing certain actions, providing them with feedback and updates.

When a user makes a reservation, the data is saved to local storage, and the reservation details are displayed as cards below the form. Users also have the ability to delete a reservation if needed.

Contact Page
